Script won't run outside of Python because arguments/variables are not being piped in.

InDesign document needs to be opened.

MAYBE JUST FIND WAY TO UNDO INSTEAD OF REVERSE LOOPING THING GOING ON.

Resumes are saved in order of links in jobs.csv.

More than two placeholder replacements can be made to work.
    - Add new array elements in line 41 of main.py
    - Add new placeholder keywords in line 53 of cover-letters-generator.jsx

    Whole script system won't error out if the lengths of 'jobs_List_Extracted' and
    'placeholder' don't match. They just won't "line-up" right in the document and
    some keywords won't change or seem go anywhere!
    The order of  'jobs_List_Extracted' matches/pairs/"lines-up" with the order
    of the placeholder keywords in 'placeholder' (jsx). And I just happened to
    make the order of 'placeholder' array flow in the document.

    Insert this code anywhere in main.py to fill more array elements in 'Jobs_CSV_Extracted'
    when testing - works as placeholder (not be confused w/ variable) when not wanting
    to pull more data in with the scraper!
        import string
        import random
        def random_string(length):
            return ''.join(random.choice(string.ascii_letters) for m in range(length))

        EG: jobs_List_Extracted.extend([[random_string(5), random_string(3), jobTitle.get_text().strip(), jobCo.getText().strip()]]) #  Needs to be double-bracket to make list of lists

            no xrange in Python 3 thus is 'range'  https://stackoverflow.com/a/95100
